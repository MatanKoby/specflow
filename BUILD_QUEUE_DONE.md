# Build Queue — Completed History

One-paragraph summaries of every shipped batch, newest at the top. Skim this for context when
picking a new claim. The full implementation history is in `git log` + `CLAIMS_DONE.md`.

<!-- Append a summary here when you finish a batch (see specflow/procedures/finish-batch.md).
     Format, e.g.:

## Batch 1 — <title>
Shipped <what> in <where>. Key commit `<sha>`. <One line on any follow-up deferred.>
-->

## Batch U2 — Self-documenting, edit-resistant region markers
Baked a "managed by specflow; do not edit inside" note into the `specflow:start` marker (an HTML
comment — invisible in rendered markdown, visible in the raw file). Made marker matching token-based
(regex on `specflow:start`/`specflow:end`) so the note can evolve without breaking parsing or forcing
a migration; a clean `upgrade` canonicalizes a file's markers to the template's wording. Key commit
`66442e0`. Smoke suite at 19 checks; dogfooded onto the repo's own files. No follow-ups.

## Batch U — Non-destructive upgrade redesign
Made `upgrade` non-destructive: managed files (`AGENTS.md` + procedures) wrap their generated content
in `<!-- specflow:start/end -->` markers, `init` records a SHA-256 of each region in the stamp's
`managed` map, and `upgrade` refreshes only the region — preserving everything outside, leaving a
hand-edited (drifted) region untouched with a `.specflow-new` sidecar, and migrating pre-marker
installs via a `.specflow-bak` backup. Key commit `42cd047`. Smoke suite at 18 checks; dogfooded onto
specflow's own root files. No follow-ups specific to U.
