# Claims

Execution-state ledger, managed by coding agents. Records who is working on what and the recent
completion log. The user does not normally edit this. Procedures:
`specflow/procedures/claim-batch.md`, `specflow/procedures/finish-batch.md`, and
`specflow/procedures/prune-ledgers.md`.

Entry format:

```
### Batch N — <short title>
- Owner: <agent>
- Started: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM        (UTC)
- Finished: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM       (only in Completed)
- Commit: <short SHA>              (only in Completed)
- Handoff note: ...                (only when a mid-batch handoff occurred)

<up to 8 lines of "What shipped": what changed, where, what a resuming agent must know first>
- Full narrative: `specflow/history/BUILD_QUEUE_DONE.md` → Batch N
```

The completed entry is a **stub**, not the record. This file is re-read on every claim, finish, and
prune, so the batch's full narrative lives in `specflow/history/BUILD_QUEUE_DONE.md` and the stub
says only enough for a resuming agent to know whether it needs to go read it. `specflow finish`
refuses a stub over 8 lines.

## In progress

<!-- One entry per actively claimed batch. -->

## Completed

<!-- Recent finishes, newest first. Bounded working set: the 5 newest stay here and
     prune-ledgers moves the rest to specflow/history/CLAIMS_DONE.md. -->
